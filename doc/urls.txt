/a/* are admin-only URLs (require superuser privilege)

/i/* are instructor URLs, which require either superuser
privilege, or an instructor role in the Course being accessed.

All instructor URLs use the first component of the path info
to specify the integer id of the course being accessed.

/i/course/* URLs have a "subfunction", i.e.

  /i/course/index --- to list all courses
  /i/course/regStudent --- to register a student

The course URLs are instructor URLs, so they have a course as
the first pathinfo element, e.g.

  i/course/index/1

would access the main course page for the course with id=1.

/u/* URLs are "unprivileged" URLs, meaning you just need to have
a user account.

TODO: should course/student URLs have a component to identify
the user id?  My thought is no, since the user is identified
either by logging in or by providing credentials to the request.

TODO: There will be course ids for some /u/* URLs, i.e., you must
be registered in a course to see its content.
